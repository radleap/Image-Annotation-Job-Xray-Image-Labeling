![Labeled Healthy Chest Xray][image1]


## General Project Details

## Proposal and Final Project Paper

Problem Statement: The aim is label x-ray data as Pneumonia or healthy, using FigureEight platform (https://www.figure-eight.com/). This will allows for instructions, test questions, and overall design.

Evaluation: Accuracy is our test metric for the 16 images that are labeled. We are also looking for accurate results among the distribution of answers for yes/no.

## Requirements
See the requirements.txt file for necessary packages. 

## Data
Original Data: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
As, applicable, see directories "static" for supporting data/files, and "templates" for HTML templates.

## Outputs
- A jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis, reviewing images, and any data science related preparation.
- Instructions_Preview.html designed on Figure-Eight. The file includes instructions, examples, and some sample test questions.
- A pdf Proposal file, which is a writeup that details design considerations and strategies for quality assurance.
- Labeled dataset (after the job is run)

## Motivation

This is to learn AI Product Management, through the Udacity AI Product Manager Nanodegree.
